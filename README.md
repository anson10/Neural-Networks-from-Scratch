# Neural Network From Scratch - Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal learning journey through the book **Neural Network From Scratch** by [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex). The goal of this project is to document my understanding of neural networks and implement the concepts explained in each chapter of the book.

## Structure of the Repository

Each chapter is organized into its own folder. In each folder, you'll find:

- **Notes:** Summaries of the key concepts from the chapter.
- **Code:** Python implementations of the neural network concepts covered.
