# Neural Network from Scratch - Fashion MNIST

##  Dataset: Fashion MNIST

### 1. Data Preparation

#### a. Load Data
- **Overview**: The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of:
  - **60,000** training images
  - **10,000** test images
- **Image Details**:
  - **Size**: 28x28 pixels
  - **Type**: Grayscale
- **Categories**: Includes 10 classes of clothing items (e.g., T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, etc.).

---

#### b. Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: 
  - Scale pixel values from **0-255** to **0-1** to improve training efficiency.
- **Reshaping**: 
  - Adjust image dimensions to fit the input requirements of your neural network.

---

#### c. Shuffling
- **Purpose**: Randomly shuffle training data to:
  - Prevent learning biases from the data order.
  - Ensure the model learns general patterns rather than memorizing sequences.

---

#### d. Batches
- **Why Batches?**: Dividing the dataset into smaller batches allows:
  - **Efficiency**: Faster training and reduced memory usage.
  - **Generalization**: Helps the model learn better by updating weights after processing each batch.
- **Common Batch Sizes**: 32, 64, or 128, depending on resources and model architecture.

---

### 2. Training

- **Process**:
  1. **Input Batches**: Feed each batch of images into the neural network.
  2. **Forward Pass**: Compute output predictions and calculate loss by comparing predictions with actual labels.
  3. **Backward Pass**: Update model weights using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent) to minimize loss.
  
- **Training Epochs**: Repeat the process for multiple epochs, passing through the entire training dataset each time.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Track loss and accuracy on both training and validation datasets.
  - Implement techniques like early stopping or learning rate adjustments to optimize training.


## Conclusion
By following these steps for data preparation and training, you'll be well on your way to building an effective neural network from scratch using the Fashion MNIST dataset!
