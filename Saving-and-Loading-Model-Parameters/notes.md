# Saving and Loading Models and Their Parameters

## 1. Retrieving Parameters

In a neural network, **parameters** (such as weights and biases) are essential components that control the learning process. Retrieving these parameters allows you to inspect their current values, which can be important for debugging or understanding how the model is performing.

## 2. Setting Parameters

Setting parameters involves updating the values of weights and biases manually. This can be useful when you want to initialize your model with specific values or load parameters from a previous model.

---

## 3. Saving Parameters

Saving parameters involves storing the current state of the weights and biases in a file. This allows you to reuse or share your model without retraining from scratch. Typically, saving parameters ensures that the model can continue from where it left off.

---

## 4. Loading Parameters

Loading parameters means retrieving saved weights and biases from a file and applying them to the current model. This is useful when you want to resume training, perform inference, or transfer knowledge from a pre-trained model.

## 5. Saving the Model

Saving a model includes saving both its architecture and parameters. This allows for full recovery of the model later. The saved file can be shared, deployed, or loaded at a later stage for further tasks.

## 6. Loading the Model

Loading the model involves retrieving the saved architecture and parameters. After loading, the model will be in the exact state it was during the save. This is useful for tasks like inference or further training, without needing to redefine or retrain the model.
